# TOP_Calculator
Another assignment for the Odin Project using Js / Jquery, css, and html.

- This application makes use of the [bootstrap Framework v4.0.0-beta.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework))
- Jquery ver. 3.2.1

DEV
- NodeJS
- NPM

I did borrow some code and modified the [css for the buttons](https://codepen.io/tmrDevelops/pen/VeRvKX) from the amazing [Tiffany Rayside](https://codepen.io/tmrDevelops). OMG, so much talent in this one!
